# TIC-TAC-TOE
Minimax is a kind of recursive algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally. It is widely used in two-player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, etc.

In minimax, there are two players. They are called minimizer and maximizer. The maximizer always tries to get the possible maximum score and the minimizer is the opposite always gets the minimum score in the worst-case scenario.

Alpha-beta pruning is the optimized method of the minimax algorithm.
